# twi
The Wikipedia Index

This was created for a college module to help me understand tf-idf information retrieval schemes.  At the moment only BM25 has been implemented.

This design is based around two Docker containers running node.js and Redis.  The node.js container invokes twi.js which is a worker script that listens on a Redis list called 'worker'.  The twi worker commands are JSON requests and include the commands `getlinks`, `getpage`, and `flush`.  

The `getlinks` command expects a query formatted for the MediaWiki module that returns a list of pages.  The example in `start.js` uses the Wikipedia:Vital_articles page to get the top 1000 pages from Wikipedia.  The twi worker processing the `getlinks` query then sends the links coming back from Wikipedia as individual `getpage`.

The twi worker receiving the `getpage` command expects the page info structure as a parameter, and requests the content of the page.  This is then passed through Porter stemming and a term frequency count before the details are put into Redis.

The `calc_weights.js` script loops over all currently indexed document terms and calculates the normalised weights according to the BM25 algorithm.  The `query.js` runs a document similarity calculation based on the stored weights.

This design and its use of Docker comtainers is intended to allow multiple workers to fetch pages in parallel because different workers can process the getpage requests on the Redis list.  Currently the load balancing doesn't work very well because getpage is not handled as a synchronous request.

At the moment I start the Docker containers using the docker-compose.yml file:

```
> docker-compose up
```

And then I run these three commands:

```
> node start
> node calc_weights
> node query
```

The following Redis keys are created/updated as a result of processing a page:

* term:&lt;term> - Sorted set of pageid and term frequency values for &lt;term>
* cterm:&lt;term> - Number of pages containing &lt;term>
* page:&lt;pageid> - info property of Wikipedia page &lt;pageid>
* pages - Count of the number of pages indexed
* dl:&lt;pageid> - Document length of page &lt;pageid>
* dltot - Sum total of all document lengths
